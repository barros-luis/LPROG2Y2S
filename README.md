## 🚀 How to Use This Repo

You can browse the code and grammar files directly or clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/LPROG2Y2S.git
```

To experiment with the ANTLR grammars and Java code:
1. Make sure you have Java and ANTLR installed.
2. Generate parser/lexer files from the grammar.
3. Compile and run the Java code as described in the project notes.
